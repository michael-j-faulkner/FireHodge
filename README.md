# FireHodge
I spent the summer of 2021 learning the fundamentals of C++. Towards the end of the summer, I wanted to do something fun with what I had learned,
so I decided to make a simple game using the <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/">Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML)</a>.

In the game, you must avoid an onslaught of fireballs for just under 2 minutes. To start the game (and restart if you die) simply press the spacebar. To move to the different positions along
the grid, use the arrow keys. If you would like to play the game yourself, you can download the repository and 
compile the code using Visual Studio (the necessary SFML library files are included). Click below to see a sample of the game in action:
